# A mapping of SG publish types to file extensions. The file publishers will not
# accept files whose extensions are not found in one of these lists when the
# "Publish all file types" setting is False. When "Publish all file types" is
# True, the publishers will use the publish type matching the extension if it
# exists in this list, otherwise, the publish type will simply be the extension
# itself. To associate other extensions with existing publish types or to add
# new Publish types, simply update the list below.
